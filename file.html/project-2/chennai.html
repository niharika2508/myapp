    <p>Chennai also known as Madras[A] (the official name until 1996), is the capital city of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The state's largest city in area and population as well, Chennai is located on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal, and is the most prominent cultural, economic and educational centre of South India.According to the 2011 Indian census, Chennai is the sixth-most populous city in the country and forms the fourth-most populous urban agglomeration. The Greater Chennai Corporation is the civic body responsible for the city; it is the oldest city corporation of India, established in 1688â€”the second oldest in the world after London. The city of Chennai is coterminous with Chennai district, which together with the adjoining suburbs constitutes the Chennai Metropolitan Area,[note 1] the 36th-largest urban area in the world by population[22] and one of the largest metropolitan economies of India.</p>

It was ranked the 43rd-most visited city in the world for the year 2015[23] and was ranked the 36th-most visited city in the world for the year 2019.[24] The Quality of Living Survey rated Chennai as the safest city in India.[25] Chennai attracts 45 percent of health tourists visiting India, and 30 to 40 percent of domestic health tourists.[26] As such, it is termed "India's health capital".[27][28] An established port of trade of British India since the 1600s, Chennai has the fifth-largest urban economy,[20] and had the third-largest expatriate population in India, at 35,000 in 2009, 82,790 in 2011 and estimated at over 100,000 by 2016.[29][30] Tourism-guide publisher Lonely Planet named Chennai as one of the top ten cities in the world to visit in 2015.[31]</p>
